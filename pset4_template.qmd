**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 
<<<<<<< HEAD

## Style Points (10 pts)
## Submission Steps (10 pts)
=======
We use (`*`) to indicate a problem that we think might be time consuming. 
    
## Style Points (10 pts) 
Please refer to the minilesson on code style
**[here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/share/pG_wQ-pHTQrJTmqNn4rcrw5V194M2H2s-2jdy8oVhWHkd_yZt9o162IWurpA-fxU.BIQlSgZLRYctvzp-)**.

## Submission Steps (10 pts)
1. This problem set is a paired problem set.
2. Play paper, scissors, rock to determine who goes first. Call that person *Partner 1*.
    - Partner 1 (name and cnet ID):
    - Partner 2 (name and cnet ID):
3. Partner 1 will accept the `ps4` and then share the link it creates with their partner. You can only share it with one partner so you will not be able to change it after your partner has accepted. 
4. "This submission is our work alone and complies with the 30538 integrity policy." Add your initials to indicate your agreement: \*\*\_\_\*\* \*\*\_\_\*\*
5. "I have uploaded the names of anyone else other than my partner and I worked with on the problem set **[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/185usrCREQaUbvAXpWhChkjghdGgmAZXA3lPWpXLLsts/edit)**"  (1 point)
6. Late coins used this pset: \*\*\_\_\*\* Late coins left after submission: \*\*\_\_\*\*
7. Knit your `ps4.qmd` to an PDF file to make `ps4.pdf`, 
    * The PDF should not be more than 25 pages. Use `head()` and re-size figures when appropriate. 
8. (Partner 1): push  `ps4.qmd` and `ps4.pdf` to your github repo.
9. (Partner 1): submit `ps4.pdf` via Gradescope. Add your partner on Gradescope.
10. (Partner 1): tag your submission in Gradescope

**Important:** Repositories are for tracking code. **Do not commit the data or shapefiles to your repo.** The best way to do this is with `.gitignore`, which we have covered in class. If you do accidentally commit the data, Github has a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history). The best course of action depends on whether you have pushed yet. This also means that both partners will have to download the initial raw data and any data cleaning code will need to be re-run on both partners' computers.

## Download and explore the Provider of Services (POS) file (10 pts)

1. What are the Variables I pulled? 
```{python}
import pandas as pd 
import altair as alt
import os
```

```{python}
# Reading dataset
path = "/Users/tsaili-ting/Uchicago/Year2/Y2Fall/Python2/problem-set-4-gena-ting/"

path_2016 = os.path.join(path, "pos2016.csv")
pos2016 = pd.read_csv(path_2016)

#variable pull 

pos2016.columns
```

1. Provider Category
2. Provider Category sub
3. City
4. Hospital Name
5. CMS Number
6. Termination code
7. Termination or Expiration Date
8. ZIP code

2. 
    a. How many hospitals are reported in this data? 
```{python}
pos2016_s = pos2016.loc[(pos2016["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"]==1)&(pos2016["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"]==1)]

len(pos2016_s)
```

    The number of short-term hospital in the dataset is 7245.
    
    b.Does this number make sense? Cross-reference with other sources and cite the numberyou compared it to.

     However, according to American Hospital Association(https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals), there are only 5129 community hospital. Citing that "Excluded are hospitals not accessible by the general public, such as prison hospitals or college infirmaries." in AHA's number. 
    
3. Plot the number of observations in your dataset by year.
```{python}
# Read 2017,18,19 dataset 
path_2017 = os.path.join(path, "pos2017.csv")
path_2018 = os.path.join(path, "pos2018.csv")
path_2019 = os.path.join(path, "pos2019.csv")

pos2017 = pd.read_csv(path_2017)
pos2018 = pd.read_csv(path_2018,encoding="latin1")
pos2019 = pd.read_csv(path_2019,encoding="latin1")

```

```{python}
# filter only short term hospital 
pos2017_s = pos2017.loc[(pos2017["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"]==1)&(pos2017["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"]==1)]
pos2018_s = pos2018.loc[(pos2018["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"]==1)&(pos2018["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"]==1)]
pos2019_s = pos2019.loc[(pos2019["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"]==1)&(pos2019["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"]==1)]

```

```{python}
# Add a column represent the fisical year, and append data

pos2016_s["Year"] = "2016"
pos2017_s["Year"] = "2017"
pos2018_s["Year"] = "2018"
pos2019_s["Year"] = "2019"

# Append the dataset
pos_combine = pd.concat([pos2016_s, pos2017_s, pos2018_s, pos2019_s], ignore_index=True)
```

```{python}
# plot the observations by year
alt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows()
alt.Chart(pos_combine).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('Year:N',  
            title="Year"),
    y=alt.Y('count()', title="Number of Observation",scale=alt.Scale(domain=[7000, 7500]))
).properties( title='Number of Observations over Year')
```

4. 
    a. Plot the number of unique hospitals in your dataset per year.

```{python}
# aggregate by year and calculate the unique number 
unique_hospital = pos_combine.groupby('Year')['PRVDR_NUM'].nunique().reset_index()
```
```{python}

alt.Chart(unique_hospital).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('Year:N', title="Year"),
    y=alt.Y('PRVDR_NUM:Q', title="Number of Unique Observations")
    ).properties(
    title='Number of Observations over Year'
)
```

b. Compare this to your plot in the previous step. What does this tell you about the structure of the data?

Look at the two graph they are identical, but we can also check the exact number of each year. 

```{python}
pos_combine.groupby("Year").agg(NumberOfHospital = ("Year","count")).reset_index()
```

```{python}
unique_hospital
```

They are exactly the same number, meaning each row is a unique hospital.
